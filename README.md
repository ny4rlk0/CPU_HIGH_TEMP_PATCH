# RYZEN_5800HX_HIGH_TEMP_PATCH
  Extract everything on C drive. Run PATCH with right click Admin. Boom Patched. (10-20 C temp difference in games. With same performance.)
  Again i am warning you this is specially for ACER Nitro 5 AN-51545. It might brick any other computer.

# If your computer is not that then you will patch it with cmd.
  Double click and add reg file.
  Set active to your max performance plan.
  Edit your Max performanca plan in advanced settings and change Proccessor Power Managment > Proccessor Performance boost mode > Set both of them DISABLED.
  APPLY and EXIT.
  NOW your cpu should heat less. (Really tho i shouldn't even bother with this. Acer should patch this instead of burning our brand new computer at max cpu temp.)
