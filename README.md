# RYZEN_5800HX_HIGH_TEMP_PATCH
  </br> Extract everything on C drive. </br> Run PATCH with right click Admin. </br> Boom Patched. (10-20 C temp difference in games. With same performance.)
  </br> Again i am warning you this is specially for ACER Nitro 5 AN-51545. It might brick any other computer. </br> (Or it might run normally. Idk, i haven't be able to test any other computer.)

# If your computer is not that then you will patch it manually.
  </br> Double click and add reg file.
  </br> Set active to your max performance plan.
  </br> Edit your Max performance plan in advanced settings and change Proccessor Power Managment > Proccessor Performance boost mode > Set both of them DISABLED.
  </br> APPLY and EXIT.
  </br> NOW your cpu should heat less. (Really tho i shouldn't even bother with this. Acer should patch this instead of burning our brand new computer at max cpu temp.)
